# calculator-BEDMAS
My attempt to making a calculator that follows BEDMAS. Sounds like it's going to be hard but that's the fun of it!
Edit: Figuring out how to do it on my own was hard but the new experience was worth it. Had to learn different tools Java had to solve the problems I had. In the end the calculator is able to follow bedmas and seems to work fine. Will add details here and there to touch it up and improve the look/functionality.
